## Answer the following in your Notebook

1. What are the coordinates of the red sprite?

2. What are the coordinates of the green sprite?

3. List at least 4 blocks from the Motion tab that will change the position of a sprite.

## Make sure you know how to use the `say` block

1. Open Snap! and start a new Project.
2. Using the `say` block have your sprite say "Hello World".
