# Do Now 1.3: Drawing a Triangle

## Setup

Open the [starter Snap! project](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=aspiece%40gmail.com&ProjectName=Equalteral%20Triangle), exit full screen, and save it to your account. You can use this as a starting point for today's lab.

> Try enabling `Visible steps` near the middle of the top toolbar. Adjust the slider so you can see what happens as *Snap!* steps through your program.
