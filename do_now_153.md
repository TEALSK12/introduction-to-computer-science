## Do Now 1.05 Day 3

Click on this [starter project](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=whuangpha&ProjectName=160201%20Do%20Now%20Bat%20and%20Dragon).

Look at the code on the Bat's script page and how events are triggered by two different keys. Trace through the scripts to understand how the code works.

Modify the program so that the Bat flies to the Dragon when the space key is pressed ONCE.
Program the Bat to say "BOO!" when it stops.
Program the Dragon to then turn around say, "You scared me!".
Program the Bat to then turn around and fly away.
