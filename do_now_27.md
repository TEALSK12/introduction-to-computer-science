# Do Now 2.7 Bouncing Ball

1. Open a new Snap project and change the sprite's costume to a ball.
2. Using the following blocks, write a script that continuously moves the ball across the screen and bounces the ball when it hits the edge of the screen.

3. Add a second sprite.  Add the same script from step 2 above for the new sprite.
4. What happens when you run?  Explain what you observe.
