# Do Now 5.3 Star Wars Troopers using Cloning

1. Yesterday we started the day using duplicate to program 5 Star Wars troopers to march across the stage.  Today we will use Snap's clone feature.

2. Go to this [Snap!project](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=whuangpha&ProjectName=160425%20Do%20Now%20cloning). Using the following "create a clone of" block, create a script so there are 5 clone troopers that move from the right side of the screen to the left side in a straight line when green flag is clicked. The starting and ending positions of the sprites are shown below.
