# traditional Grudgeball Instructions

1. Each team gets 10 "X's".
2. Split your class into 5 or 6 teams, depending on how fast you want the game to go.
3. Each group gets a question.  If they get it right they automatically get to erase two X's from the board.  They can take it from one team or split it.  They can not commit suicide (take X's from themselves).
4. Before they take off these X's, though, they have a chance to increase their ability to get the other teams to hate them.  They get to shoot the Nerf ball.  I set up two lines with masking tape.  One is a two point line while the other is a three pointer.  
5. If they shoot from the two point line and get it in, they can take four X's off the board.  If they go from the three point line, and make it in, they can take five off the board.  If they don't make it they still get to take the original two off the board.

## Instruction

1. Prepare 3-6 teams of 5-6 students team.
2. Prepare a worksheet of 4-5 questions for each team.

    * Each document should be uploaded to a cloud service in order to share the link to the file for the whole group to work on.

3. While students are coming up with their answers, prepare the game board by adding an image or graphic above each number.
