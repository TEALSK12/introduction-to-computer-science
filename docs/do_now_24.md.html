# Do Now 2.4 Debugging

Take a look at the [Two Sprites Tag](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=andrewspiece&ProjectName=Do_Now%202.4_Starter) game.

* In this two-player game, Alonzo is trying to catch the Blue Dog. Both Alonzo and the Blue Dog are controlled using keys on the keyboard.
* There are at least six bugs in this program - four of them affect the game play and two of them are cosmetic.
* Fix all of the bugs to get the scripts working correctly.

## Respond to the following in your notebook

1. What keys were used to control Alonzo?
2. What keys were used to control the dog?
3. List at least six bugs in the program and explain what the bugs are and how to fix them.

__Bonus:__ Once you get the game working, can you think of some changes to make it more fun?
