# Helping Trios

## Overview

In Helping Trios, each student presents something they are working on and get help from classmates. Group students in trios and ask students to take a couple of minutes to complete the first question in the handout.

In their groups, each student will have a total of five minutes to speak:

* 2-3 min to describe their challenge.
* 2-3 min to get peer feedback and write it down in their notebooks.

## Instructions

Students do not want to give each other the answers but help each other by providing advice on how to figure out a way to solve their problem.

Have students keep their answers to the questions in a their so you and the student can track their improvement over time. This can be a supplement to any written feedback you have given the student.
