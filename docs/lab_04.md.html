# Getting to know you

In this lab, you will explore and create a simple "self-portrait" program to introduce yourself to your teachers and classmates.

## Part 1 - Exploring

1. Open a new project.

2. In order to save your project, the first thing you'll need to do is to create an account. In the browser window, find the cloud-shaped button in the top toolbar on the upper left corner of the window.
    ![The cloud menu button](images/cloud_button.png)

    Click it, select the "sign up" option in the menu, and follow the instructions there. You will need to check your email after creating your account to get your initial password.  Your username will be the first part of your school email address.  If you need help, ask.

3. Spend a few minutes looking around, trying things out, and experience what the language can do.

4. Write down three things in your notebook you found that the environment can do and how to do them. Be as specific as you can!

     | You can do this...| If I do this... |
     | --- | --- |
     | 1.  |     |
     | 2.  |     |
     | 3.  |   |

5. Find a partner and compare notes.  Share your findings with your partner and ask them about what they learned.  Write down the three capabilities your partner found below.

     | You can do this... | If I do this... |
     | --- | --- |
     | 1.  |     |
     | 2.  |     |
     | 3.  |     |

## Part 2 - Self - portrait

Using what you've learned and other things you might discover, create a program that describes yourself. This can take whatever form and use whatever tools and blocks you want. Make sure your script includes following information:

* Your name
* Your current grade
* Your age
* Your favorite subject in school.
* One of your hobbies or interests.
* Any previous programming or computer experience you have.
* Example of something you learned
* What you think learning CS will be like?
* What are some of your favorite uses of technology?

1. Save your project as _Lab0.4_.

2. Submit your _self portrait_ using the submission instructions given to you by your instructor. If you are having trouble saving, here is a great video:  [https://youtu.be/VHts_QAp3XU](https://youtu.be/VHts_QAp3XU)
