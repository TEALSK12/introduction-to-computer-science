## Using zoom blocks

![Zoom Blocks](images/zoom_blocks.png)

Zoom blocks are a useful tool to increase the readability of script in Snap!. To access the zoom blocks feature, simply go up to settings in the upper left, and select the second option in the list, zoom blocks. Once selected, an interface pops up which allows you to increase the zoom on your script and shows you a preview.

## Instructor's notes

### Day 1

#### Introductory discussion

Review the definitions of _algorithm_ and _program_ developed in lesson 0.2.

* **Algorithm:** a complete, well-defined sequence of steps for completing a task or solving a problem.
* **Program:** a sequence of instructions or steps, written in a language that can be understood by a computer, that will be used by the computer to complete a task or solve a problem.

#### Activity walkthrough

Work through [Welcome to Snap!](lab_11.md.html) lab through part 3 as a class.
Point out key aspects of Snap! in each section, including:

* Part 1 - the sections of the window.
* Part 2 - block shapes and color-coding of pallettes
* Draw attention to the different shapes. Their meanings will be covered as each block type is introduced.
* The "drag-and-drop" nature of the language.
* Running blocks/scripts by clicking on them.
* Ensure that all students can create an account and save their work.
* Allow students a few minutes to develop their own answers to each of the questions and activities before discussing as a class.

#### Activity

Individually or in pairs, have students continue working through the [Welcome to Snap!](lab_11.md.html) lab activity.  

* Students should answer all questions and complete all activities and turn them in using your chosen turn-in procedure.
* For scripts, including the kaleidoscope script, students should save the script to the cloud and share a link with you.

#### Turn-in procedures

Remind students of the turn in procedures introduced in Unit 0.

### Day 2

#### Review

Go over answers to the questions from the parts of the lab completed on day 1.

#### Discussion

Consider the following questions:

* Can you name the different parts of the browser window?
* Can you define _block_, _reporter_, and _script_ ?
* Can you Describe, in your own words, the coordinate system?

#### Continue lab

As before, students should turn in all answers using your chosen turn-in procedure.
Judge the appropriate time based on observing student progress.

#### Debrief and wrap-up

Discuss the challenges in the Kaleidoscope script.

* If time allows, ask one or two students to demonstrate and describe their scripts.

Remind students of the turn-in procedures discussed yesterday and ensure all students can turn in their work.

## Accommodations and differentiation

For students that finish the lab early, encourage them to add more advanced features to their Kaleidoscope script, exploring parts of Snap! not covered in the lab.

Students that are struggling with the lab can be paired and receive individual instruction to help them through the activity.  You can also use [helping trios activity](helping_trios.md.html).

No parts of this lab can be easily skipped without impacting learning objectives, so provide as much support or scaffolding as you can to ensure all students can complete the lab.  Add days to the lesson if needed.
