# Lesson 1.2: Building blocks

## Learning objectives

## Instructor's notes

### Introductory discussion

#### Do now debrief

Tell the story of [Admiral Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) who originated the term "debugging".

* You could also use this _Who is Grace Hopper?_ video: [https://youtu.be/Fg82iV-L8ZY](https://youtu.be/Fg82iV-L8ZY)

Review concepts from the previous lesson.

* Ensure that students can:
  1. Define _block_ and _script_.
  2. Review snapping blocks together to make a script.
  3. Review how blocks are executed in order.

Introduce the concept of block pallettes.

* Ask students to consider why pallettes are helpful as opposed to having a simple list of blocks.

### Activity

Individually or in pairs, have students work through the [scavenger hunt](lab_12.md.html) activity.
Students should turn in answers to all questions and scripts for the final problems.
Consider gamifying the worksheet or debrief as an online poll and/or quiz.

### Debrief

Go through each question or prompt in parts 1 and 2 and ask students to share their answer.

  > **Cold calling alternative:** Write each student’s name on an index card and shuffle the cards. Next, ask a few “review” questions to set the stage that ask for application (or creativity, or evaluation) and have no single “right answer.” Give students 30 to 60 seconds to formulate an answer. You can have them talk in pairs or groups for a few minutes as well if you prefer. It’s only after students have been thinking that you take the top card to see who answers. Sometimes you can say something like, “If you don’t know, make something up like you would on a mid-term, and then we’ll all help you develop better answers.” The student takes their best shot, knowing that others will help if necessary.
  At that point you have lots of options:  You can ask a follow-up to the same student, pick another card and have somebody else answer the follow-up, or simply have students volunteer to expand on the first answer.
  >**Remote cold calling adaptation**
  >Consider using this [Random name generator](Excel-Randomizer.xlsx) to select a student in a remote setting.

Point out the color coding for each pallette.

Emphasize important details in some of the blocks listed in part 2, such as:

* The **think** block will leave the bubble on the stage until something else is thought.

  ![Think Block](images/think.png)

* the **go to xy** block and **glide** block blocks require explicit _x_ and _y_ coordinates.

  ![Go to XY block](images/go_to_x_y.png) ![Glide block](images/glide.png)

Call on a few student responses for each pallette before commenting yourself.

* Try to guide students to discuss with each other and settle on a description for each pallette with minimal instructor intervention.

Discuss one or two student solutions to each of the programming problems.

* Point out differences between student solutions and call attention to the fact that there is more than one way to solve a problem.

## Accommodations and differentiation

Colorblind students may not be able to identify the block colors, but can still recognize the organization of pallettes. Be sensitive to this, but no modifications are likely required.

Students that are struggling with the lab can work with another student or receive individual instructor attention to help them through the activity. Consider using [helping trios](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%201%20PDF/Helping%20Trios.pdf) if appropriate.

The bonus assignment should be used for students who finish quickly.
