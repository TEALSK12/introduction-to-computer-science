# Lesson 1.3: Drawing Shapes

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Construct simple algorithms to draw shapes
* Convert algorithms into SNAP programs

## Materials/Preparation

* [Do Now 1.3: Drawing a Triangle](do_now_13.md.html) You can ask students to give instructions in plain language, pseudo code or with images.
* [Lab 1.3 handout](lab_13.md.html) (Squares and Triangles and Stars, Oh My!) ([Download in Word](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%201%20Word/Lab%201.3%20Squares%20Triangles.docx)) ([Link to PDF](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%201%20PDF/Lab%201.3%20Squares%20Triangles.pdf))
* [Geometry Exterior Angles Review](Geometry_Exterior_Angles.pdf)
  * This gives the angles of a few basic shapes and the formula to determine the exterior angle of the shape they want to draw.
* Do Now [Starter Code](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=aspiece%40gmail.com&ProjectName=Equalteral%20Triangle)
* [Unit 1 Tips](unit_1_tips.md.html)

## Instructor's Notes

### 1.  Review

* Review the categories of blocks and what each is for.
* Put emphasis on Motion and Drawing, as those will be used for this assignment
* Remind students about the iterative process of programming
* Students may get frustrated throughout this activity; remind them that requiring multiple attempts to find the right solution is normal.

### Scaffolding Accomodation
*  If your students have not learned the exterior angles of a triangle, it is important to go over [Geometry Exterior Angles Review](Geometry_Exterior_Angles.pdf) with them.
  * Focus on the shapes on this document and the formula used to determine the angle. 
  * This will help them determine find the angles of any shape.


### 2.  Activity

* Students should complete the ["Triangles, Squares, and Stars, Oh My!"](lab_13.md.html) activity individually.
* Point out that the shapes in part 2.1 are not necessarily listed from easiest to hardest, and that the scripts need not be written in the given order.
  * This will give them the tools they need to figure out the angles they ned for any shape they would like to draw.
* When students finish, have them turn in their project using whatever procedures you have set up.

### 3.  Debrief

* Have students switch seats with a nearby classmate and review each other's work
* If one in a pair student was able to complete a program and the other was not, have the student who was successful walk his/her partner through
* If neither student in a pair was able to complete a program, encourage them to work together to figure out what they were missing
* Make sure course staff is available to help pairs who cannot figure out a given problem
* Ask students to share what they learned from looking at their partner's programs
* Point out the fact that there is more than one way to solve a problem and two programs that are both correct might not look the same

## Accommodations/Differentiation

* Students who have not learned the exterior angles of a shape, will need this document as they figure out exterior angles. [Geometry Exterior Angles Review](Geometry_Exterior_Angles.pdf)
* Advanced students can attempt the five-pointed star. If students finish that shape, encourage them to try more advanced shapes.
  * Examples: Kite, smiley face, student's initials
* Struggling students can either be paired or allowed to not complete certain shapes.
* Students who have not yet learned angles of triangles may have difficulty determining the correct angles. Point out to them that geometric understanding is not necessary—the angles can be determined using trial and error.
  * If students need more scaffolding, they can be pointed to an online resource such as <http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/interior-angles-polygons.html>
  * If most students are not equipped to figure out the angles on their own, provide diagrams like the one in part 1.1 to assist.
