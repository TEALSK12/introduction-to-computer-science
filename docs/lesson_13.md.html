# Lesson 1.3: Drawing Shapes

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Construct simple algorithms to draw shapes.
* Convert algorithms into Snap! programs.

## Materials/Preparation

* [Do Now 1.3: Drawing a Triangle](do_now_13.md.html) You can ask students to give instructions in plain language, pseudo code or with images.
* [1.3 Slide Deck](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/slidedecks/TEALS%20SNAP%201.3.pptx)
* [Lab 1.3 handout (Squares and Triangles and Stars, Oh My!)](lab_13.md.html) ([docx](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%201%20Word/Lab%201.3%20Squares%20Triangles.docx)) ([pdf](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%201%20PDF/Lab%201.3%20Squares%20Triangles.pdf)).
* [Geometry Exterior Angles Review](Geometry_Exterior_Angles.pdf)
  * This gives the angles of a few basic shapes and the formula to determine the exterior angle of the shape they want to draw.
* Do Now [Starter Code](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=aspiece%40gmail.com&ProjectName=Equalteral%20Triangle).
* [Unit 1 Tips](unit_1_tips.md.html).
* Video Resource: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLU3PtaG3ww](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLU3PtaG3ww)
  * Video Quiz: See Additional Curriculum Materials accessed from the TEALS Dashboard.

## Instructor's Notes

### Review

* Review the categories of blocks and what each is for.
* Put emphasis on Motion and Drawing, as those will be used for this assignment.
* Remind students about the iterative process of programming.
* Students may get frustrated throughout this activity; remind them that requiring multiple attempts to find the right solution is normal.

### Introduce the following Blocks from the Pen Category

| Block name | Block Image | Description |
| :--- | :--- | --- |
| `clear` | ![Clear](images/clear.png) | Clears all pen marks from the stage. |
| `pen up` | ![Pen Up](images/pen_up.png) | Picks up the pen from the stage. |
| `pen down` | ![Pen Down](images/pen_down.png) | Puts down the pen on the stage. |
| `set pen color to` | ![set pen color to](images/set_pen_color_to.png)| Sets the pen color to the indicated color. |
| `set pen size to` |![set pen size to](images/set_pen_size_to.png)| Set the pen thickness to 1. |
| `change pen size by` | ![change pen size by](images/change_pen_size_by.png) | Changes the pen size by 1. |

### Introduce the following Blocks from the Looks Category

| Block name | Block Image | Description |
| :--- | :--- | --- |
| `Show` | ![Show](images/show.png) | Shows the sprite on the stage. |
| `Hide` | ![Hide](images/hide.png) | Hides the Sprite from the stage. |

### Scaffolding and Accommodations

* Review Exterior Angles of Regular Polygons [Geometry Exterior Angles Review](Geometry_Exterior_Angles.pdf) with the class.
  * Focus on the shapes on this document and the formula used to determine the angle.
  * This will help them determine find the angles of any regular shape.

### Activity

* Students should complete the ["Triangles, Squares, and Stars, Oh My!"](lab_13.md.html) activity individually.
* Point out that the shapes in part 2.1 are not necessarily listed from easiest to hardest, and that the scripts need not be written in the given order.
  * This will give them the tools they need to figure out the angles they need for any shape they would like to draw.
* When students finish, have them turn in their project using whatever procedures you have set up.

### Debrief

* Have students switch seats with a nearby classmate and review each other's work.
* If one in a pair student was able to complete a program and the other was not, have the student who was successful walk his/her partner through.
* If neither student in a pair was able to complete a program, encourage them to work together to figure out what they were missing.
* Make sure course staff is available to help pairs who cannot figure out a given problem.
* Ask students to share what they learned from looking at their partner's programs.
* Point out the fact that there is more than one way to solve a problem and two programs that are both correct might not look the same.

## Accommodations/Differentiation

* Advanced students can attempt the five-pointed star. If students finish that shape, encourage them to try more advanced shapes.
  * Examples: Kite, smiley face, student's initials
* Struggling students can either be paired or allowed to not complete certain shapes.
* Students who have not yet taken geometry may have difficulty determining the correct angles. Point out to them that geometric understanding is not necessaryâ€”the angles can be determined using trial and error.
  * If students need more scaffolding, they can be pointed to an online resource such as <http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/interior-angles-polygons.html>
  * If most students are not equipped to figure out the angles on their own, provide diagrams like the one of a triangle in part 1.1 to assist.
