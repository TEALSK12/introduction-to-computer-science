## Instructor's notes

### Review

Review the pallettes of blocks and what each is for.

* Put emphasis on motion and drawing pallettes.
* Remind students about the iterative process of programming.
* Students may get frustrated throughout this activity. Remind them that requiring multiple attempts to find the right solution is normal.

### Introduce the following blocks

| Block name | Block image | description |
| :--- | :--- | --- |
| **clear** | ![Clear](images/clear.png) | Clears all pen marks from the stage. |
| **pen up** | ![Pen Up](images/pen_up.png) | Picks up the pen from the stage. |
| **pen down** | ![Pen Down](images/pen_down.png) | Puts down the pen on the stage. |
| **set pen color to** | ![set pen color to](images/set_pen_color_to.png)| Sets the pen color to the indicated color. |
| **set pen size to** |![set pen size to](images/set_pen_size_to.png)| Set the pen thickness to 1. |
| **change pen size by** | ![change pen size by](images/change_pen_size_by.png) | Changes the pen size by 1. |

| Block name | Block image | description |
| :--- | :--- | --- |
| **Show** | ![Show](images/show.png) | Shows the sprite on the stage. |
| **Hide** | ![Hide](images/hide.png) | Hides the Sprite from the stage. |

### Scaffolding

Review [exterior angles of regular polygons](Geometry_Exterior_Angles.pdf) with the class.

* Focus on the shapes on this document and the formula used to determine the angle.
* This will help them determine find the angles of any regular shape.

### Activity

Students should complete the ["Triangles, squares, and stars"](lab_13.md.html) activity individually.

* This will give them the tools they need to figure out the angles they need for any shape they would like to draw.

When students finish, have them turn in their project using whatever procedures you have set up.

### Debrief

Have students switch seats with a nearby classmate and review each other's work.

* If one in a pair student was able to complete a program and the other was not, have the student who was successful walk his/her partner through.
* If neither student in a pair was able to complete a program, encourage them to work together to figure out what they were missing.

Ask students to share what they learned from looking at their partner's projects.

Point out that there is more than one way to solve a problem and two programs that are both correct might not look the same.

## Accommodations and differentiation

Advanced students can attempt the five-pointed star. If students finish that shape, encourage them to try more advanced shapes.

* Examples: kite, smiley face, student's initials

Struggling students can either be paired or allowed to not complete certain shapes.
Students who have not yet learned the skills necessary in determining the correct angles. Point out to them that geometric understanding is not necessary and the angles can be determined using trial and error.
