# Lesson 2.3: Inputs and conditionals

## Student objectives

Students will be able to...

* Apply **ask** and **receive** blocks.
* Apply simple conditional, **if** and **if-else** blocks, to alter control flow in a program.

## Instructor's notes

### Lecture

Point out that, so far, our scripts have had minimal interactivity. There was _some_ user interaction in the shape drawing labs, but no back and forth. Just pushing a key to trigger an action.

* This is not normally how scripts work.

Ask students for examples of interactive computer programs.

Ask students for suggestions for making previous labs or activities more interactive. There are no right or wrong answers here. The goal is to get students thinking about interactivity.

Introduce the **ask_and wait** block.

  ![Ask Block](images/ask.png)

Demonstrate that it functions similar to the **say** block but waits for a response from the user.

  ![Say Block](images/say.png)

The response is stored in the **answer** block and can be referenced later.

  ![Answer Block](images/answer.png)

Variables will not be introduced until unit 3, so this block will be somewhat magical for now.  You should judge your students' preparedness to handle the details and act accordingly.

* Emphasize that only one input is stored at a time, and that asking a new question deletes the previous answer.
* For example, the following script, intended to draw a bunch of squares where the user specifies both the size and the number of squares, will not work as intended:

    ![Draw Squares Example script](images/draw_squares.png)

#### Introduce conditional statements

Define **conditional** - a block used to make a choice between executing two different chunks of script.

You can also use this [video on conditionals](https://www.flocabulary.com/unit/coding-conditionals/) by Flocabulary.

* Point out the differences between **if** and **if/else** block.

    ![If Block](images/if.png)

    ![If Else Block](images/if_else.png)

* Namely, if-else provides a choice between two script paths, whereas if simply chooses between executing script or not
* Emphasize that **only one** of the bodies, either the if or the else, will ever be executed.

Show students the relational operators (<, >, and =).

  ![equal to](images/equalto.png)

### Activity

Direct students to complete the [What shape is that?](lab_23.md.html) activity individually or in pairs.

### Debrief

Discuss one or two students solutions.

* Point out differences between the approaches of different students and lead discussion about advantages and disadvantages.
* Place particular emphasis on the choice between if and if-else blocks.

Explain that, when conditions are mutually exclusive (as in part 2.1), a series of if vs. if-else blocks can be functionally equivalent.

* When the conditions are not mutually exclusive (as in part 2.2), the choice matters more.

## Accommodation and differentiation

Advanced students can be encouraged to add extra functionality, such as attempting to draw the shape the user is specifying or identifying types of triangles (equilateral, isosceles, scalene)

Students who are struggling can be allowed to skip some parts of the tables in 2.1 and 2.2, focusing on just a few cases
