# Lesson 2.5: Boole in the House

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

- Define and identify Boolean expressions and operators
- Evaluate Boolean expressions
- Utilize Boolean operators (and/or/not) to create compound conditions

## Materials/Preparation

- [Do Now 2.5: Variables Practice](do_now_25.md.html)
- [Lab 2.5 handout (Triangles of All Kinds)](lab_25.md.html) ([Download in Word](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%202%20Word/Lab%202.5%20Triangles%20of%20All%20Kinds.docx)) ([Link to PDF](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%202%20PDF/Lab%202.5%20Triangles%20of%20All%20Kinds.pdf))
- [Unit 2 Tips](unit_1_tips.md.html)

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Review

- Remind students about conditional statements, and ask what the blocks that can go in the holes in if blocks have in common
- Blocks are "pointy" and all  are "yes/no" or "true/false" questions

### 2. Lecture

- Introduce Booleans with the ["Stand Up, Sit Down:"](https://curriculum.code.org/csd-1718/unit3/10/) Warm Up activity of the Code.org "Booleans Unplugged" lesson
- Define **Boolean expressions** as expressions that evaluate to true or false
  - If desired, explain that the term "Boolean" is derived from [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole)
- In SNAP, all Boolean expressions are pointy six-sided blocks
- Present the three Boolean operators: and, or and not
- Define the operators and describe when each will return true
- Show the truth tables for each operator and explain how to read them (see below for truth table example)
- Truth tables are simply one way of expressing how the Boolean operators work; if students are struggling, other depictions (such as an exhaustive list of all possible results) can be substituted
- Emphasize that since Boolean operators are themselves Boolean expressions, they can be nested
- Practice evaluating Boolean expressions, starting simple and moving to more complex nested operations
- Start with simple expressions: e.g. `5 < 7 AND 4 > 2`
- Introduce variables: e.g. `x = 7; x < 5 OR x > 10`
- Nest operations: e.g. `(x = 4; y = -3; x == y OR (x > 0 AND y < 0))`
- Discuss short-circuiting in evaluation of Boolean expressions
- Discuss situations in which the Boolean operators might be needed
- The lack of <= and >= operators in SNAP makes for a great example

### 3.  Activity

- Students should complete the ["Triangles of All Kinds"](lab_25.md.html) activity individually or in diverse pairs (students who have not interacted previously, by ability, etc.)
- A number of geometric concepts (Triangle Inequality Theorem, Pythagorean Theorem, etc.) are used in this lab, but students need not have a deep understanding of them.  The necessary points are explained in the lab.
- Encourage students to think about whether an "and" or an "or" is appropriate in each case.  Draw out truth tables if necessary.
- As done previously in the unit, you can make the [Geometry Cheatsheet](https://www.math-salamanders.com/image-files/geometry-cheat-sheet-2-2d-shapes.gif) available to students.

### 4.  Debrief

- Walk through a student's response
- Point out uses of Boolean operators
- Discuss how nested or chained if blocks could potentially be used to obtain the same behavior, but would result in longer, less-readable code

## Logical AND truth table

|   p   |   q   | p and q |
| ----- | ------| ------- |
| true  | true  | true    |
| true  | false | false   |
| false | true  | false   |
| false | false | false   |

## Logical OR truth table

|   p   |   q   | p or q |
| ----- | ------| ------ |
| true  | true  | true   |
| true  | false | true   |
| false | true  | true   |
| false | false | false  |

## Logical NOT truth table

|   p   | not p |
| ----- | ------|
| true  | false |
| false | true  |

## Accommodations/Differentiation

- Students that have not taken Geometry made be intimidated by some of the concepts in the lab.  Deep understanding of the theorems is not necessary; encourage the students to simply focus on the equations and inequalities presented.
- If the students continue to struggle, help them build the necessary expressions, but encourage them to assemble them into the full condition on their own.
- Advanced students, especially those who have taken higher levels of math, can be encouraged to add additional functionality, such as using [Heron's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula) to calculate the triangles area or using trigonometry to attempt to draw the triangle.
- Drawing the triangle is very challenging.
