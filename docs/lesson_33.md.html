## Instructor's Notes

### Lecture

#### Introduce block arguments

* Define **Arguments:** An argument is any area in a block that accepts user input, or another block. It could be a Boolean Block or a value placed inside of a variable or block.
* Ask students to speculate on risks of relying on variables instead of arguments.
* Variables could be changed by code other than the custom block, variable names could be changed causing errors, etc.
* Emphasize importance of custom blocks being self-contained.
* Custom blocks should continue to function correctly independent of any other changes in the program.
* Custom blocks should work correctly anywhere in the program and not require specific setup or cleanup.
* Point out how frustrating code would be if blocks like  `move 10 steps` required setting a variable with a specific name to work.

#### Demonstrate declaration and usage of arguments

* Point out that arguments are very similar to script variables, except their values come outside the block.
* Explain argument types.
  * Only discuss text, numbers, and Booleans.
  * Other types can be mentioned, but won't be used in the course.
  * Ask students to describe why restricting types is important.
  * Point out that arguments are passed by value.
  * Specifically, changing the value of an argument inside a custom block will typically NOT change the value at the call site.
  * [Arguments example](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=brettwo&ProjectName=Lesson%203.3)
    * Basic argument in pen category
    * Pass by value example in "Variables" category

### Activity

* Students should complete the [Let Me Check My Calendar](lab_33.md.html) activity individually or in pairs
* This lab consists of a series of independent custom blocks.  The blocks need not necessarily be completed in the order given, but are roughly in order of difficulty.
* The bonus (part 3.4) requires implementing a fairly complex formula.

### Debrief

* Ask a different student to provide their solution to each part.  
* If time allows, discuss multiple solutions to each part.
* Emphasize differences and encourage discussion about advantages and disadvantages.
* Point out corner cases and cases where typed arguments are particularly helpful.
* For example, avoiding try to find out whether "bubblegum" is a leap year

## Accommodations/Differentiation

* Part 3.4 is a fairly complex formula and should be a challenge for advanced students.
* Struggling students should focus on section 1. The problems in section 2 represent more complex algorithms, but not necessarily any more difficult usage of arguments.
