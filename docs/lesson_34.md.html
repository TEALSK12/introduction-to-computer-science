## Instructor's Notes

### Lecture

#### Introduce reporter blocks

* Ask students to find blocks with the reporter shape (round) and speculate as to what they do.
* Point out familiar examples, such as:
  * ![x position block](images/x_position.png)
  * ![answer block](images/answer.png)
  * ![pick random block](images/pick_random.png)
* Explain the concept of reporting (returning) a value, and how reporter blocks are used to provide values to commands.
* Emphasize that reporters do not (and should not) perform any action. They are used to compute values which are used by commands.

#### Introduce predicate blocks (as a special case of reporter blocks)

* Emphasize that predicates must return true or false.
* Be aware, but don't necessarily tell students, that Snap! does not enforce this.
* Point out examples, such as:
  * ![Touching Block](images/touching.png)
  * ![less than block](images/less_than.png)
  * ![and block](images/and.png)
* Ask students why it might be useful to differentiate predicates from other reporters.
* Only predicates can be used in a conditional.

### Activity

* Students should complete the ["If My Calculations Are Correct..."](lab_34.md.html) activity individually.
* This lab consists of a series of independent custom blocks.  The blocks need not necessarily be completed in the order given.
* Work with students to ensure they are testing their blocks properly and reporting correct values.

### Debrief

* Ask a different student to provide their solution to each part.  If time permits, go over multiple students' work for each part.
* Point out differences and discuss advantages and disadvantages to different approaches.
* Emphasize that custom blocks do not have to be long and complicated to be useful.

## Accommodations/Differentiation

* Struggling students should focus on just the first 2 or 3 parts of the lab.  Even if they cannot move on to the more difficult problems, getting used to defining custom reporters is helpful and important.
* Advanced students who finish quickly can be utilized to assist other students.
* Students who struggle in math may not be familiar with the distance formula used in part 2.1.  Help students to translate the math into a Snap! script, but understanding the formula and its applications is not necessary for the activity.
* If most students are not equipped to handle this math, a simpler computation, such as area of a triangle or average of three numbers, can be substituted.
