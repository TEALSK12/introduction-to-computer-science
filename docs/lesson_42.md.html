## Instructor's Notes

### Lecture

Review the concept of a list from the previous lesson.

Ask students to brainstorm examples of when lists could be useful.

* To store an unknown number of values (e.g. a bunch of student test scores, shopping list, the songs of your favorite music artist).
* To store a collection of related values as one entity (e.g. the number of absent students each day over a week, how often a video on YouTube in a week).

Demonstrate creating lists.

* Use the [List Components](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/blob/master/Unit%204%20Word/SNAP%20Lists%20Components.docx?raw=true) file to demonstrate the list structure.
  
Use the **list** block to create a simple list.

* Point out the format in which lists are displayed (gray box with red elements).

Show that lists can be assigned to variables like other values.

* Emphasize that the list is considered a single value, even though it consists of multiple values.
* Point out and explain basic list operations blocks.

The **item**, **add**, and **delete** blocks will be most important.  The **length** block will be useful as well.

* Point out that these blocks all take a list as an argument.

### Activity

Students should complete the [You Talkin' to Me?](lab_42.md.html) activity individually or in pairs.

* Encourage students to be creative with their word lists.
* Don't allow students to fixate on the exact grammatical correctness of generated phrases and sentences.
* If this is a major concern, choose words for the lists such that generated phrases will always be grammatically correct.

### Debrief

Ask a student to present and discuss their solution to each step.

* Emphasizes uses of lists and encourage students to discuss and think about why lists were necessary.

Ask students to consider if the tasks would have been doable without lists.

## Accommodations and differentiation

In addition to the bonuses in the lab, advanced students can attempt further extensions of the grammar, including conjunctions, non-transitive verb phrases, and/or recursive rules (e.g. multiple adjectives).  

A more complex context-free grammar for English sentences can be found [here](http://www.cs.uccs.edu/~jkalita/work/cs589/2013/12Grammars.pdf).

Struggling students should focus on generating a noun phrase from only a few words. The other parts of speech and phrase types can be omitted without losing the key learning objectives.

Non-native English speakers or those with low literacy may struggle with the grammatical concepts here.  Since the grammar is not the key objective, feel free to scaffold liberally and/or substitute a different type of grammar.

You can also provide a grammar supplement with [example sentences](https://www.woodwardenglish.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/parts-of-speech-english.jpg).
