# Lesson 4.3: List Practice I

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Traverse a list, accessing each element one at a time.
* Perform operations combining all elements in a list.
* Select defined subsets of elements in a list.

## Instructor's Notes

### Lecture

#### In small diverse groups, ask students to consider how to count the number of students with July birthdays in the room

* Provide only a few minutes to work through this-- students need not write full, formal algorithms, but simply describe an approach.
* Have groups share with each other and work together to come up with a single approach, hopefully settling on asking each student if s/he has a July birthday and counting the number of yeses (or something similar).

#### Define **traversal** as the process of accessing each element of a list in order and performing some operation

* Call out that the operation can be anything, and may not actually be performed on every element.
* Provide a few examples of possible operations (say each person's name, count the number of females, add up the total number of siblings, find the average GPA, etc.)
* Explain that traversing is how many problems involving lists are solved.

#### As a group, develop sample script for a simple list traversal, such as the following

![Simple List Traversal](images/simple_list_traversal.png)

* Ask leading questions to help students write each line of code, one a time, then gradually put the pieces together ("build up" approach).
* Point out that the `say` block can be replaced by any script (including larger blocks of scripting for more complex operations), but that the rest of the script will typically be the same.
* Emphasize that the "index" variable is keeping track of where we currently are in the list, and can be used in the traversal operation if wanted, as in:

  ![Use index In Loop Example](images/use_index_in_loop.png)

### Activity

* Students should complete the [Guess Who](lab_43.md.html) activity individually or in pairs
* Students will be performing several traversal operations, some of which simulate mapping, filtering, or reducing/folding the list.  You can discuss these operations if you feel the class can handle it.
* Part 1.3 requires use of the `join` block. Be sure that the students are comfortable using this block.

### Wrap-up

* Ask students to briefly describe how the various parts of the lab were similar or different
* Hopefully the students find that the scripts were quite similar for each part.
* Ask students to describe something they found challenging about the lab
* You will go over the correct solutions to the lab in the next lesson

## BJC Lecture Suggestion

BJC Video Suggestion :[BJC Lecture 9: Recursion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKn3nsfzBdA)

* Movie “Inception” as an example of recursion 0:00-0:50
* Recursion 0:50-1:40
* Recursion Demo in Snap! 1:40-17:00
* Overview 17:00-21:00
* Definition of Recursion 21:00-24:30
* Examples of Recursion (You Already Know It!) 24:30-26:20
* Trust the Recursion 26:22-29:40
* Summary of Recursion 29:40-End

## Accommodations/Differentiation

* Advanced students can attempt more complex filters in part 2.3 (such as finding all names that contain at least two vowels) and/or more advanced maps in part 1.3 (such as greeting each person by first initial).
* Struggling students should focus on parts 1.2, 2.1, and select items from part 2.3.  Partial script can be provided.
