# Lesson 4.4: List Practice II

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

- Traverse a list, accessing each element one at a time
- Perform operations combining all elements in a list
- Select defined subsets of elements in a list

## Materials/Preparation

- [Do Now 4.4: Traversing List](do_now_44.md.html)
- [Lab 4.4 handout (Number Cruncher)](lab_44.md.html) ([docx](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%204%20Word/Lab%204.4%20Number%20Cruncher.docx)) ([pdf](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%204%20PDF/Lab%204.4%20Number%20Cruncher.pdf))
- [Unit 4 Tips](unit_4_tips.md.html)

## Instructor's Notes

### Review

- Ask students to define **traversal** and outline the basic code pattern.
  - You need not write actual code here, but have students mention the key points (index variable, use index to access each item, repeat length of list, etc.).
- Review solutions to lab 4.3.
- Ask a student to provide their solution to each part.
  - Discuss errors or flaws in each solution.
  - Point out similarities between each part, emphasizing that the basic code pattern is the same each time with only the operation performed on each item changing.
- If you feel students can handle it, you can further classify various traversals (maps, filters, folds).
  - If necessary, provide the basic code pattern for a traversal again:

### Activity

- Students should complete the [Number Cruncher](lab_44.md.html) lab individually.
- The operations in this lab are fairly similar to those in lab 4.3, but work with lists of numbers instead of names.  As a result, students should progress more quickly.
- As in lab 4.3, help students realize that the basic code pattern in each part will be the same.

### Debrief

- Ask one or two students to share their solution to each part of the lab.
- If all students seem to grasp the concept, not all parts need to be reviewed.
- If skipping some parts, be sure to review at least parts 1.1 (a fold), 2.1 (a map) and 2.2 (a filter).
- Point out that the solutions from labs 4.3 and 4.4 will look quite similar, even though in lab 4.3 the lists contained names in in lab 4.4 they contained numbers.
- The traversal code pattern is the same regardless of the type of elements in the list.

## Accommodations/Differentiation

- Advanced students should complete both bonus parts of the lab (1.5 and 2.3) and then assist struggling students.
- Students who need more assistance should focus on parts 1.3, 2.1, and 2.2.  Ensure that all students are able to complete at least these three parts before concluding the lesson.
