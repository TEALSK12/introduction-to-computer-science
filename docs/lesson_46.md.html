# Lesson 4.6: Guess My Word Project

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

- Use lists to implement a complete version of "Guess My Word"
- Exercise good programming practices to produce code that is not only functional but also elegant and well-written

## Materials/Preparation

- [Do Now 4.6: Gentle Guess My Word](do_now_46.md.html)
- [Project 4 - Guess My Word](project_4.md.html) ([Download in Word](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/blob/master/Unit%204%20Word/Project%204%20Guessmyword.docx?raw=true)) ([Link to PDF](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%204%20PDF/Project%204%20Guessmyword.pdf))
- Guess My Word planning worksheet: ([Download in Word](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Projects/Projects%20Word/Project_4_Guessmyword_Planning_Worksheet.docx)) ([Link to PDF](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Projects/Projects%20PDF/Project_4_Guessmyword_Planning_Worksheet.pdf))
- Link to an online version of a word guessing game, such as <http://www.searchamateur.com/Play-Free-Online-Games/Bubbletoonia-Cake-Deal.htm>
- A word list from which words can be selected for the game, such as [Word List]

## Instructor's Notes

- Review/Introduction
- Review the various skills and concepts have been learned so far in the unit. Consider making it a Kahoot! game.
- Put particular emphasis on the maintenance of lists and traversals
- Remind students that their solutions to previous assignments are an excellent resource when trying to accomplish similar tasks.
- Walk students through the project specification, pointing out important details, potential pitfalls, and requirements.
- Focus students' attention on the checkpoints to help them avoid becoming overwhelmed.
- Help students import the word list into a SNAP list, either by right-clicking on the list view and selecting "import" or by parsing the online list directly using the `http://` block.  This is not one of the objectives of the project, so feel free to provide starter code if you prefer.
- Emphasize that generating the "word pattern" or "blanks" and keeping that sequence up-to-date with each guess is the hardest part of the assignment, and should not be overlooked.
- Remind students that it will be important to keep straight what each variable and list in the program is used for.  Each variable or list should have a single purpose, and those purposes should never be conflated.
- Project
- This is a summative assessment project.  Students should be given at least a few days in class to work on the project.  The exact schedule should be determined by your teaching team based on overall class capability and other factors.
- If most students have the ability to work at home, you can consider reducing the amount of in-class time provided and requiring students to spend time working at home.
- Provide a means for students to ask questions throughout the project and provide assistance as needed.

## Accommodations/Differentiation

- If any students do not have the ability to work at home, ensure enough in-class time is provided to complete the assignment, offering extensions if necessary.
- Advanced students can be encouraged to add extensions such as:
  - Enabling guessing of the entire word
  - Allowing the user to specify the length of the word to be guessed
  - Keeping statistics (win-loss record, fewest guesses, etc.) across games
  - Struggling students can be given starter code or exempted from certain features
  - Though it is the most difficult part of the assignment, tracking the "blanks" is the best practice working with lists and should be preserved.  
  - The requirements to display a graphical figure, track repeated guesses, and specifically recognize a win can be removed for students in need of significant simplification.
