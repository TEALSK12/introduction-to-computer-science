# Master Vocabulary List

Introduction to Computer Science - 1st Semester

## A

<hr />

### Abstraction

Removing the specifics that are not relevant in a given context.

### Argument

Any area in a block that accepts user input, or another block. It could be a Boolean Block or a value placed inside of a variable or block. The value that is "passed into" a parameter of a custom block.

## B

<hr />

### Backgrounds

Pictures that fill the entire stage area.

### Block

Puzzle-piece shapes that are used to create code in snap!

### Boolean Expression

A value (text, number, picture, etc.) that evaluate to true or false.

### Boolean Operators

Boolean expressions that can be nested.

## C

<hr />

### Command Block

Puzzle-piece shaped block that executes a command (it causes an effect).

### Cloning

A feature that allows a sprite to create a clone, or semi-duplicate, of itself, while the project is running. Clones of a sprite will be the same as the original or parent sprite but as a separate instance. Clones inherit the parent's scripts, costumes, sounds, and properties, yet they can then be modified.

### Conditional

A block used to make a choice between executing two different chunks of code."If" statements.

### Contains Block

Checks an operator block for a particular variable.

### Costume

A costume is one out of possibly many "frames" or alternate appearances of a sprite.

### Custom Blocks

Allow for one to make their own programming blocks.

## D

<hr />

### Detail Removal

Reducing the complexity of an algorithm or process by focusing on the important parts.

## E

<hr />

`No E entries`

## F

<hr />

### Functions/Methods

Other programming languages, like Python or Java, use these terms to refer to the same idea as a Custom Block in Snap! a reusable.

## G

<hr />

### Generalization

Combining a group of related concepts or processes into a single category.

### Global Variable

A variable that can be used by all of your sprites.

## H

<hr />

`No H entries`

## I

<hr />

### Index Variable

Keeps track of where you currently are in a list.

## J

<hr />

### Join Block

Links two values together and reports the result.

### Jukebox

A collection of sounds that can be applied to a sprite costume.

## K

<hr />

`No K entries`

## L

<hr />

### Lists Block

A block which controls a list.

### List Element

A part of a list.

### Loop

A type of block that causes other code to run multiple times in succession. A control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.

## M

<hr />

### Modeling

Building a system to simulate the behavior of a real-life phenomenon by simplifying or ignoring certain details.

## N

<hr />

### Nested Loop

A loop used inside the body of another loop.

## O

<hr />

### Operator Block

A block that performs math functions and string handling.

## P

<hr />

### Predicate Block

A hexagonal block that always returns a Boolean value (true or false).

### Procedural Decomposition

Breaking a problem down into smaller subtasks, usually to increase readability and/or maintainability, often by applying one of the above concepts.

### Programming List

Called an 'array' in most programming languages, this holds lots of values.

## Q

<hr />

`No Q entries`

## R

<hr />

### Receive Block

Code Block in Control that receives a message from another block.

### Reporter Block

Report a value, usually for use in another block's input slot.

## S

<hr />

### Say Block

The block gives its sprite a speech bubble with the specified text — the speech bubble stays until an another speech or thought block is activated, or the stop sign is pressed.

### Scenario

A description of a set of interactions and/or tasks that describe a start-to-finish example of how a user might want to use the application

### Snap

Snap! is an extended reimplementation of [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) that allows you to Build Your Own Blocks.  It also features ﬁrst class lists, ﬁrst class procedures, first class sprites, first class costumes, first class sounds, and first class continuations.  These added capabilities make it suitable for a serious introduction to computer science for high school or college students.

### Scripts

Different types of blocks linked together

### Sequential Search Algorithm

A method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched.

### Sprites

An object in Snap! Which performs functions controlled by scripts.

### Stage

The background of a project, performs functions through scripting.

### Super-sprite

A sprite that is  composed of pieces that can move together but can also be separately articulated.

## T

<hr />

### Transform

Create a new list based on the values of the old list.

### Traverse

Go through or travel across an item/list.

### Truth Tables

A tool for evaluating the possible inputs and outputs of a Boolean expression.

## U

<hr />

`No U entries`

## V

<hr />

### Variable

A placeholder for some value. Types of variables:Global variables - apply to all sprites Sprite variable - applies to one sprite Script variable - parameter that applies to one script

## W

<hr />

### Wardrobe

A collection of sprite costumes. The wardrobe is located in the Costumes tab, which is accessed through the file icon.

### Watcher Block

reporter blocks you can click the checkbox for; they will appear in the Stage and you can track them.

### Wireframe

A high-level sketch of an application's user interface intended to help visualize layout, interactions, and transitions

## X

<hr />

### X Position

The position that a sprite or the mouse is at along the horizontal axis.

## Y

<hr />

### Y Position

The position that a sprite or the mouse is at along the vertical axis.

## Z

<hr />

`No Z entries`
