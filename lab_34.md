# If my calculations are correct

In this lab, you will write custom **reporter** and **predicate** blocks to perform several useful calculations and computations.

## Simple Computations

1. Write a custom **reporter** block called **min** that determines which of two numbers is smaller and reports that value.  If the two numbers are equal, report either one.

2. Write a custom **reporter** block called **max** that determines which of two numbers is larger and reports that value.  If the two numbers are equal, report either one.

3. Write a custom **predicate** block called **between** that determines if a number is between two other numbers.  If the first number is equal to either of the other two numbers or is between them, the block should report "true".

4. Write a custom **predicate** called **at least as long as** that determines whether a word has at least a specified number of letters.

5. Save your project as _lab34_.

## Bonus: Stepping Things Up

Write a custom **reporter** block called **distance to** that computes and reports the distance from a sprite's position to another point.  Use the **x position** and **y position** blocks to determine the sprite's position.  Remember that the formula for the distance between points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is `sqrt((y2-y1)^2+(x2-x1)^2)`.
