# Lab 3.4 - If My Calculations Are Correct...

In this lab, you will write custom reporter blocks to perform a number of useful calculations and computations.

## Simple Computations

1.  Write a custom SNAP reporter block called "min" that determines which of two numbers is smaller and reports that value.  If the two numbers are equal, report either one.

2.  Write a custom SNAP reporter block called "max" that determines which of two numbers is larger and reports that value.  If the two numbers are equal, report either one.

3.  Write a custom SNAP predicate block called "between" that determines if a number is between two other numbers.  If the first number is equal to either of the other two numbers or is between them, the block should report "true".

4.  Write a custom SNAP predicate called "at least as long as" that determines whether or not word has at least a specified number of letters.

## Stepping Things Up

1.  Write a custom SNAP reporter block called "distance to" that computes and reports the distance from a sprite's position to another point.  Use the "x position" and "y position" blocks to determine the sprite's position.  Remember that the formula for the distance between points $$(x_1, y_1)$$ and $$(x_2, y_2)$$ is $$\sqrt{((y_2-y_1)^2+(x_2-x_1)^2 )}$$ .

2.  Write a custom SNAP predicate block called "contains letter" that determines whether or not a word contains a particular letter.  You can consider upper-case and lower-case letters to be different for the purposes of matching.

## Grading Scheme/Rubric

| **Lab 3.4 Criteria**        |                |
| --------------------------- | -------------- |
| min                         | 0.25 points    |
| max                         | 0.25 points    |
| between                     | 0.5 points     |
| at least as long as         | 0.5 points     |
| distance to                 | 0.5 points     |
| contains letter             | 0.5 points     |
