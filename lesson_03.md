## Instructor's notes

### Introductory discussion

* Introduce students to the concept of a **Computer program**: a sequence of instructions or steps, written in a language that can be understood by a computer, that will be used by the computer to complete a task or solve a problem.
* Ask for any programming languages students are familiar with (even just names).
* Draw distinctions between proper programming languages and other types of languages (such as markup languages e.g. HTML).
* Lead the group to develop expectations about what aspects of programming might be most challenging and what skills might be most useful to be successful.

#### Guiding questions:
  * What are the steps required to write a computer program?
    * This is essentially developing an algorithm for writing a program.
  * What knowledge might make writing a program easier?
  * What might you need to do when writing a computer program that you have never or rarely done before?
  * What parts of programming are most intimidating or scary?
  * What are you good at that might help you be a better programmer?

### Activity

* Students should work through one of the Hour of Code activities of your choice.
* Choose one activity as the requirement, and leave another for those who finish quickly.
* Allow students to struggle with the activities if needed, stressing the importance of patience and persistence in programming.
* Have students submit the certificate of completion of their hour of code to the instructor.
* _Remote Guidance_: The certificates can be submitted digitally upon completion.

### Debrief

* Guide students in a discussion about the activities. Some sample guiding questions:
  * What was most challenging?
  * Put special emphasis on the iterative nature of programming, and the need to occasionally throw out a partial solution and start over.
  * What was different about solving these problems than solving other problems encountered in school?
  * Why can instructions not be given in simple English? Why must we be limited to certain operations from which we must build up solutions?
  * If students seem interested, this can be an opportunity for a brief conversation about the difference between high-level programming languages and machine languages (assembly code).

## Accommodations/differentiation

* If students appear to be frustrated enough to not be enjoying the activity, provide a step in the right direction and remind them that programmers rarely create a correct program on the first try.
