## Instructor's notes

### Introduce activity

Play [introductory video](https://youtu.be/b-EWj7xN90U) of Snap! put together by Jens Moenig

Tell students that today they will explore and use it to create a "self-portrait" script.

* Emphasize that the goal of today's lesson is **_not_** for students to develop a deep understanding of any of the features. Later lessons will teach them everything they need to know.  For now, they should just explore, figure out what they can, and put it to use however they see fit.

* Tell students they will create accounts so they can save their self-portraits and share them.
* Give students the link to the student experience survey. Tell them that answering these questions will help them to think about themselves and give them some ideas for their self-portraits.

Spend just a couple minutes demonstrating, create sprites and scripts, and run scripts.

Show students the [lab handout](lab_04.md) and read through the instructions.

* Point out the places to write answers to the written questions in parts 1.2 and 1.3.
* Draw special attention to the list of requirements for the self-portrait script in part 1.4.
* This is an excellent opportunity to tell students that all labs in this course will look like this, and that they should get used to reading instructions carefully.

### Student experiences survey

Instruct students to complete the [student experiences survey](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%200/Student%20Experiences%20Survey.docx).

Students should answer every question and “I don’t know” or “I’m not sure” are okay answers.

* Privacy notice: make sure you do not publish students submissions to this survey.

#### Optional

If you have a digital camera available, you can take photos of the students for use in the self-portraits.

* Doing so will give a level of personalization to each student's project.
* You will need to provide students with a location to download their photo.

In addition you need to walk students through the process of importing a costume from the file menu.  

### Activity

Instruct students to complete the [getting to know you](lab_04.md) lab.

* Make sure they understand what your expectations are for student account names.
* Verify that every student has an account.
* If you have a digital camera available, you can take photos of the students and have them use their picture as the costume to the sprite.  Doing so will give a level of personalization to each student's project.  You will need to provide students with a location to download their photo.  In addition you need to walk students through the process of importing a costume from the file menu.

### Save and share

Instruct students on how to Save their projects and what they should be named.

Here is a great video of how to share a script - [https://youtu.be/VHts_QAp3XU](https://youtu.be/VHts_QAp3XU)

Students will be able to share the URL of their projects for submission purposes.

### Debrief

Ask each student to identify and describe _one_ feature they discovered in script.  Keep a running list on the whiteboard or projector.

* If the students build a pretty comprehensive list, you can use this as a chance to go over a brief roadmap for the course.
* Ask students what they enjoyed about working with script and what they disliked.

## Accommodation and differentiation

Allow students to use whatever resources they need, including instructors, peers, and web searches if necessary, to create their scripts.  The goal of this lesson is exploration and exposure, not mastery.

For students that are hesitant or unwilling to engage, point out some simple, useful features (like basic drawing and the **Say** block) to get them started.  Remind them that complexity or "coolness" are not important for this lab.

If you wish, you can add a second day to this lesson for students to share out their scripts on a volunteer basis.  Work with your classroom teacher and/or school IT staff to determine the best way for students to be able to present.

One simple option is to have volunteering students share their projects with you, and then show each one in turn on the teacher computer/projector.

Have a plan for collecting or accumulating the students' scripts, which you can then use to get to know your class!
