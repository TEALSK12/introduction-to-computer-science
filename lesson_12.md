# Lesson 1.2: Building Blocks

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

-   Name the categories of blocks in SNAP and describe what the blocks in each category do
-   Describe the function of several common SNAP blocks (see [lab](lab_12.md) for specific blocks)
-   Be able to use common blocks to build simple SNAP programs (see [lab](lab_12.md) for specific blocks)

## Materials/Preparation

-   [Do Now 1.2: Tracing and Debugging](do_now_12.md)  
-   [Lab 1.2](lab_12.md) handout (SNAP Scavenger Hunt) ([Download in Word](https://tealsk12.gitbooks.io/introduction-to-computer-science/content/Unit%201%20Word/Lab%201.2%20SNAP%20Scavenger%20Hunt.docx)) ([Link to PDF](https://tealsk12.gitbooks.io/introduction-to-computer-science/content/Unit%201%20PDF/Lab%201.2%20SNAP%20Scavenger%20Hunt.pdf))
-   Read through the handout so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Notes

1.  Introductory discussion

    -   Review the basics of SNAP from the previous lesson
        -   Ensure that students can:
            -   Define "block" and "script"
            -   Describe how to build a script (snapping blocks together)
            -   Explain how scripts are executed (one block at a time in order)
    -   Introduce the concept of block categories
        -   Ask students to consider why categories are helpful as opposed to having a simple list of blocks

2.  Activity

    -   Individually or in pairs, have students work through the ["SNAP Scavenger Hunt"](lab_12.md) activity
        -   Students should turn in answers to all questions and SNAP programs for the final problems

3.  Debrief
    -   Go through each question or prompt in parts 1 and 2 and ask students to share their answer
        -   Cold calling works well for this lab due to the large number of questions
        -   Point out the color coding for each category
        -   Emphasize important details in some of the blocks listed in part 2, such as:
            -   the ![](think.png) block will leave the bubble on the stage until something else is thought
            -   the ![](gotox-y.png) and ![](glide.png) blocks require explicit x- and y-coordinates
        -   Solicit a few student responses for each category in part 2.2 before commenting yourself
            -   Try to guide the students to discuss with each other and settle on a description for each category with minimal instructor intervention
    -   Discuss one or two student solutions to each of the SNAP programming problems
        -   Either solicit volunteers or cold call
        -   Point out differences between student solutions and call attention to the fact that there is more than one way to solve a problem

## Accommodations/Differentiation

-   Colorblind students may not be able to identify the block colors, but can still recognize the organization of categories. Be sensitive to this, but no modifications are likely required.
-   Students that are struggling with the lab can be paired up and/or receive individual instructor attention to help them through the activity.
-   The bonus assignment (3.4) should be used for students who finish quickly, and can be a setup for the [Animation Project](project_1.md).
