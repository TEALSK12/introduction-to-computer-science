# Lesson 1.3: Drawing Shapes

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

-   Construct simple algorithms to draw shapes
-   Convert algorithms into SNAP programs

## Materials/Preparation

-   [Do Now 1.3: Drawing a Triangle](do_now_13.md) You can ask students to give instructions in plain language, pseudo code or with images.
-   [Lab 1.3 handout](lab_13.md) (Squares and Triangles and Stars, Oh My!) ([Download in Word](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%201%20Word/Lab%201.3%20Squares%20Triangles.docx)) ([Link to PDF](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%201%20PDF/Lab%201.3%20Squares%20Triangles.pdf))

## Instructor's Notes

1.  Review
    -   Review the categories of blocks and what each is for.
        -   Put particular emphasis on Motion and Drawing, as those will be used for this assignment
    -   Remind students about the iterative process of programming
        -   Students may get frustrated throughout this activity; remind them that requiring multiple attempts to find the right solution is normal.
2.  Activity
    -   Students should complete the ["Triangles, Squares, and Stars, Oh My!"](lab_13.md) activity individually.
        -   Point out that the shapes in part 2.1 are not necessarily listed from easiest to hardest, and that the scripts need not be written in the given order.
        -  Here is a [Geometry Cheat Sheet](https://www.math-salamanders.com/image-files/geometry-cheat-sheet-2-2d-shapes.gif) by Math Salamanders showing various shapes and their respective angles. It can be presented to students as a reference during the activity and/or enlarged and placed at the front of the classroom for use throughout unit 2.
    -   When students finish, have them turn in their project using whatever procedures you have set up.
3.  Debrief
    -   Have students switch seats with a nearby classmate and review each other's work
        -   If one in a pair student was able to complete a program and the other was not, have the student who was successful walk his/her partner through
        -   If neither student in a pair was able to complete a program, encourage them to work together to figure out what they were missing
            -   Make sure course staff is available to help pairs who cannot figure out a given problem
    -   Ask students to share what they learned from looking at their partner's programs
        -   Point out the fact that there is more than one way to solve a problem and two programs that are both correct might not look the same

## Accommodations/Differentiation

-   Advanced students can attempt the five-pointed star. If students finish that shape, encourage them to try more advanced shapes.
    -   Examples: Kite, smiley face, student's initials
-   Struggling students can either be paired or allowed to not complete certain shapes.
-   Students who have not yet taken geometry may have difficulty determining the correct angles. Point out to them that geometric understanding is not necessary—the angles can be determined using trial and error.
    -   If students need more scaffolding, they can be pointed to an online resource such as <http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/interior-angles-polygons.html>
    -   If most students are not equipped to figure out the angles on their own, provide diagrams like the one of a square in part 1.1 to assist.
