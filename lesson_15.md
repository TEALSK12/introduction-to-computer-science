## Instructor's Notes

1.  Review

    -   Play a review game (such as [GrudgeBall](http://toengagethemall.blogspot.com/2013/02/grudgeball-review-game-where-kids-attack.html) to remind students of the skills and concepts that have been learned in this unit
        -   Categories of blocks
        -   Movement
        -   Drawing
        -   Hide/Show
        -   Costumes
        -   Broadcasting
    -   Remind students that their solutions to previous assignments are an excellent resource when trying to accomplish similar tasks.

2.  Introduce project

    -   Walk students through project specification, pointing out important details, potential pitfalls, and specific requirements
        -   The words to the story must appear on the screen somehow
            -   This can be as a sprite, as a part of the background, or "said" by a narrator
        -   Sprites must act out the story line by line
            -   The action must be dynamic-- a series of static images is not sufficient
        -   The action and words should advance automatically, but at a slow enough pace that the viewer can follow
        -   The user must be able to restart the animation (in a manner other than pressing the green flag again) after it has concluded
        -   At least two sprites must act during the animation, and the sprites must collectively meet the requirements on page 2
    -   Encourage students to look at the grading rubric on page two repeatedly throughout the project to ensure they are meeting all the requirements

3.  Project
    -   This project is a summative assessment for the unit.  Students should be demonstrating mastery of all the skills covered.
    -   Most students will require roughly 4-8 hours of total work time to complete the project
        -   Assess the progress of your students regularly using such techniques as asking them to demonstrate their incomplete programs, tracking questions asked during lab time, and/or utilizing peer reviews.
        -   Adjust the amount of time allowed for the project to fit the needs of your students
            -   It is vital that nearly all students complete the project before moving on
        -   If most students have the ability to work on SNAP assignments at home, the amount of in-class time provided can be reduced if necessary.
            -   If this approach is taken, be sure to make accommodations for students who are _not_ able to work at home, such as after school lab hours
        -   Ensure that students are able to ask questions in class throughout the project
    -   See the standard [Lab Day Lesson](lab_day_lesson.md) for detailed plans for lab days.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

-   Instead of a scene from a play or a nursery rhyme, students can recreate a famous scene from a movie, depict lyrics from their favorite song, or develop their own unique animations.  Feel free to modify the specification for whichever version will appeal most to your students.
-   Advanced students can be encouraged to add detail and/or complexity to their project for possible extra credit.
-   For ELL students or students from other cultures, offer the opportunity to choose an animation subject familiar to them rather than requiring a traditional English nursery rhyme or play.
    -   If necessary, a non-English language can be used for this assignment without affecting the learning objectives.  Discuss this option with the student's ELL specialist to determine if it is appropriate.
