# Lesson 2.4

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Use variables to track values throughout a program
* Explain the differences between global, local (script) and instance (sprite) variables


## Materials/Preparation

* [Lab 2.4 handout (Guessing Game)](lab_24.md)

## Pacing Guide

| Duration | Description |
| -- | -- |
| 5 minutes | Welcome, attendance, bell work, announcements |
|15 minutes | Lecture and introduce activity |
|25 minutes | Guessing Game activity |
|10 minutes | Review and wrap-up |


## Instructor's Notes

* Lecture
  * Review user input, specifically the "answer" block
    * Ask students to speculate about how the "answer" block works
    * Ask students whether that type of functionality could be useful in other cases
  * Introduce variables
    * Explain the concept of a variable as a way of storing a value for retrieval later
    * Emphasize use of descriptive, readable names 
    * Discuss the fact that each variable can only hold one value at a time—changing the value causes the old value to be lost
    * Emphasize that variables are independent
      * One variables value can be assigned to another, but the second variable will not update if the first's value changes again
  * Discuss the three different types of variables (global, sprite, and script)
    * Ask students to suggest when each might be useful
    * Ask students and/or provide examples of when using the wrong type of variable might be dangerous or suboptimal
* Activity
  * Students should complete the Guessing Game activity individually or in pairs
    * Encourage students to think about which type of variable is most appropriate each time a variable is needed.
* Review
  * Discuss and demonstrate one or more students' submissions.
  * Encourage discussion about choices for variable names and types.


## Accommodations/Differentiation

* Advanced students can add a "high score" feature to the game and/or implement additional statistics (average guesses/game, number of times each secret number chosen, etc.)
  * Struggling students can be given code that completes part 1.1, and possibly part 1.2, to get them started.
  * Students who are particularly overwhelmed should focus only on parts 1.2 and 2.2.
