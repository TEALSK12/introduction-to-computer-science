## Instructor's Notes

1. Review
    * Remind students about conditional statements, and ask what the blocks that can go in the holes in if blocks have in common
        * Blocks are "pointy" and all  are "yes/no" or "true/false" questions
2. Lecture
    * Introduce and define "Boolean expressions" as expressions that evaluate to true or false
        * In SNAP, all Boolean expressions are pointy six-sided blocks
    * Present the three Boolean operators: and, or and not
        * Define the operators and describe when each will return true
        * Show the truth tables for each operator and explain how to read them
        * Emphasize that since Boolean operators are themselves Boolean expressions, they can be nested
        * Practice evaluating Boolean expressions, starting simple and moving to more complex nested operations
        * Discuss short-circuiting in evaluation of Boolean expressions
    * Discuss situations in which the Boolean operators might be needed
        * The lack of <= and >= operators in SNAP makes for a great example
3. Activity
    * Students should complete the "Triangles of All Kinds" activity individually or in pairs
        * A number of geometric concepts (Triangle Inequality Theorem, Pythagorean Theorem, etc.) are used in this lab, but students need not have a deep understanding of them.  The necessary points are explained in the lab.
        * Encourage students to think about whether an "and" or an "or" is appropriate in each case.  Draw out truth tables if necessary.
4. Debrief
    * Walk through a student's response
        * Point out uses of Boolean operators
        * Discuss how nested or chained if blocks could potentially be used to obtain the same behavior, but would result in longer, less-readable code


## Accommodations/Differentiation
* Students that have not taken Geometry made be intimidated by some of the concepts in the lab.  Deep understanding of the theorems is not necessary; encourage the students to simply focus on the equations and inequalities presented.
    * If the students continue to struggle, help them build the necessary expressions, but encourage them to assemble them into the full condition on their own.
* Advanced students, especially those who have taken higher levels of math, can be encouraged to add additional functionality, such as using [Heron's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula) to calculate the triangles area or using trigonometry to attempt to draw the triangle.
    * Drawing the triangle is very challenging.
