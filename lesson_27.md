## Instructor's Notes

1.  Review/Introduction
    -   Play a review game (such as [GrudgeBall](http://toengagethemall.blogspot.com/2013/02/grudgeball-review-game-where-kids-attack.html)) to remind students of the skills and concepts have been learned in this unit.
        -   Variables
        -   Operators

    -   Remind students that their solutions to previous assignments are an excellent resource when trying to accomplish similar tasks.
2.  Introduce project
    -   Walk students through the project specification, pointing out important details, potential pitfalls, and requirements.
        -   If students are unfamiliar with the concept of the pong game, spend a couple minutes demonstrating one for the class.  If you have a SNAP or Scratch version, that works best, but an online game (such as <http://www.ponggame.org/>) will work as well.
3.  Project

    -   This project is a summative assessment for the unit.  Students should be demonstrating mastery of all the skills covered.
    -   Most students will require roughly 6-10 hours of total work time to complete the project
        -   Assess the progress of your students regularly using such techniques as asking them to demonstate their incomplete programs, tracking questions asked during lab time, and/or utilizing peer reviews.
        -   Adjust the amount of time allowed for the project to fit the needs of your students
            -   It is vital that nearly all students complete the project before moving on
        -   If most students have the ability to work on SNAP assignments at home, the amount of in-class time provided can be reduced if necessary.
            -   If this approach is taken, be sure to make accommodations for students who are _not_ able to work at home, such as after school lab hours
        -   Ensure that students are able to ask questions in class throughout the project
    -   See the standard [Lab Day Lesson](lab_day_lesson.md) for detailed plans for lab days.

## BJC Lecture Suggestion
#### Background Information for Instructors
* [BJC Lecture 9: Recusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKn3nsfzBdA)
 - Movie “Inception” as an example of recursion 0:00-0:50
 - Recursion 0:50-1:40
 - Recursion Demo in Snap 1:40-17:00
 - Overview 17:00-21:00
 - Definition of Recursion 21:00-24:30
 - Examples of Recursion (You Already Know It!) 24:30-26:20
 - Trust the Recursion 26:22-29:40
 - Summary of Recursion 29:40-End


## Accommodations/Differentiation

-   If any students do not have the ability to work at home, ensure enough in-class time is provided to complete the assignment, offering extensions if necessary.
-   Advanced students can be encouraged to add a single-player mode with a computer-controlled opponent, recreate the original mechanic in which the ball’s angle depends on where it hit the paddle, add different “levels” with obstacles or differently shaped fields, or any other extension.
-   Struggling students can be exempted from certain features (such as ball speed or scoring) or given starter code
    -   If students need significant assistance, focus them on the ball’s movement, as it is both the most computationally interesting part of the assignment.
