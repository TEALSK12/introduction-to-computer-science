# Lesson 3.1: Combining Loops and Conditionals  

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Combine loops with conditionals to create models with repeated but conditional behavior

## Materials/Preparation

* [Do Now 3.1: Boolean Practice](do_now_31.md)

## Instructor's Notes

### 1.  Review and lecture

#### Review loops and conditionals

* Ask students what loops do, when they are useful, and what loops exist in SNAP
  * loops cause code to execute multiple times
  * loops can help reduce redundancy and increase readability
  * SNAP contains three loops: repeat, forever, and repeat until
* Ask students what conditionals are for and when they are useful
  * conditionals are used to execute a block of code only under certain circumstances
  * Encourage discussion about previous activities
  * Fill in understanding gaps when necessary

#### Demonstrate combining loops and conditionals

* Present ![Repeat Until Block](repeat%20until.png) and ![Forever Block](foreverIf.png)
* Ask students to suggest when these constructs might be useful
  * "repeat until" is useful when a loop needs to run not for a set number of iterations, but until some situation occurs
  * "forever if" is useful when code should execute _any time_ a condition is true, for the duration of the program
  * Point out that the condition in "repeat until" is a termination condition, while in "forever-if" it is a continuation condition

#### Introduce the concept of modeling

* **Modeling:** building a system to simulate the behavior of a real-life phenomenon by simplifying or ignoring certain details_
* Ask students to suggest systems or concepts that might need to be modeled
* Discuss important considerations when designing and implementing a model
  * Lead students to realize that most sacrifice some amount of accuracy or realism for simplicity

### 2.  Activity

* Students should complete "What Goes Up..." lab individually
* Mention that the code written in this lab will be helpful for the Platform Game project

### 3.  Debrief

## Accommodations/Differentiation

* Take care to ensure that all students have functional code by the end of the lab to avoid putting some students at a disadvantage starting the project
* If many students struggle, consider releasing your own solution after the lab has been completed in class
* Utilize TAs and advanced students to assist struggling studentsâ€”it is vital that all students complete this lab in advance of starting the project
* Advanced students can consider increasing the realism of their gravity model by adding acceleration and/or beginning to implement jumping
