# Lesson 4.2: Static Lists

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

-   Create static lists in SNAP
-   Access elements of a list
-   Add and remove elements from a list

## Instructor's Notes

-   Lecture
    -   Review the concept of a list from the previous lesson
        -   Ask students to brainstorm examples of when lists could be useful
            -   To store an unknown number of values (e.g. a bunch of student test scores)
            -   To store a collection of related values as one entity (e.g. the number of absent students each day over a week)
    -   Demonstrate creating lists in SNAP
        -   Use the variadic (taking a variable number of arguments) "list" block to create a simple list
        -   Point out the format in which lists are displayed (gray box with red elements)
        -   Show that lists can be assigned to variables like other values
            -   Emphasize that the list is considered a single value, even though it consists of multiple values
    -   Point out and explain basic list operations blocks
        -   The "item," "add," and "delete" blocks will be most important.  The "length" block will be useful as well.
        -   Point out that these blocks all take a list as an argument.
-   Activity
    -   Students should complete the "You Talkin' to Me?" activity individually or in pairs
        -   Encourage students to be creative with their word lists
        -   Don't allow students to fixate on the exact grammatical correctness of generated phrases and sentences
            -   If this is a major concern, choose words for the lists such that generated phrases will always be grammatically correct
-   Debrief
    -   Ask a student to present and discuss their solution to each step
        -   Emphasizes uses of lists and encourage students to discuss and think about why lists were necessary
        -   Ask students to consider if the tasks would have been doable without lists

## Accommodations/Differentiation

-   In addition to the bonuses in the lab, advanced students can attempt further extensions of the grammar, including conjunctions, non-transitive verb phrases, and/or recursive rules (e.g. multiple adjectives).  
    -   A more complex context-free grammar for English sentences can be found here: <http://www.cs.uccs.edu/~jkalita/work/cs589/2013/12Grammars.pdf>.  
-   Struggling students should focus on generating a noun phrase from only a few words.  The other parts of speech and phrase types can be omitted without losing the key learning objectives.
-   Non-native English speakers or those with low literacy may struggle with the grammatical concepts here.  Since the grammar is not the key objective, feel free to scaffold liberally and/or substitute a different type of grammar.
    -   Other grammar examples, including arithmetic expressions (which are a good simple substitute) can be found here: <https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~nelson/courses/csc_173/grammars/cfg.html>.
