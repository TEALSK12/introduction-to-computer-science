# Lesson 4.4: List Practice II

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Traverse a list, accessing each element one at a time.
* Perform operations combining all elements in a list.
* Select defined subsets of elements in a list.

## Materials/Preparation

* [Do Now 4.4: Traversing List](do_now_44.md)

## Instructor's Notes

### Review

* Ask students to define **traversal** and outline the basic script pattern.
  * You need not write a script here, but have students mention the key points (index variable, use index to access each item, repeat length of list, etc.).
* Review solutions to lab 4.3.
* Ask a student to provide their solution to each part.
  * Discuss errors or flaws in each solution.
  * Point out similarities between each part, emphasizing that the basic script pattern is the same each time with only the operation performed on each item changing.
* If you feel students can handle it, you can further classify various traversals (maps, filters, folds).
  * If necessary, provide the basic script pattern for a traversal again:

### Activity

* Students should complete the [Number Cruncher](lab_44.md) lab individually.
* The operations in this lab are fairly similar to those in lab 4.3, but work with lists of numbers instead of names.  As a result, students should progress more quickly.
* As in lab 4.3, help students realize that the basic script pattern in each part will be the same.

### Debrief

* Ask one or two students to share their solution to each part of the lab.
* If all students seem to grasp the concept, not all parts need to be reviewed.
* If skipping some parts, be sure to review at least parts 1.1 (a fold), 2.1 (a map) and 2.2 (a filter).
* Point out that the solutions from labs 4.3 and 4.4 will look quite similar, even though in lab 4.3 the lists contained names in in lab 4.4 they contained numbers.
* The traversal script pattern is the same regardless of the type of elements in the list.

## Accommodations/Differentiation

* Advanced students should complete both bonus parts of the lab (1.5 and 2.3) and then assist struggling students.
* Students who need more assistance should focus on parts 1.3, 2.1, and 2.2.  Ensure that all students are able to complete at least these three parts before concluding the lesson.
