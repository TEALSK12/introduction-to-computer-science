# Lesson 5.1: Intro to Cloning

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

-   Explain why prototyping and clones can be useful
-   Describe how complex goals can be accomplished using cloning

## Materials/Preparation
- [Lab 5.1 Handout](lab_51.md) (Connect the Dots) ([Download in Word](Unit 5 Word/Lab 5.1 Connect the Dots.docx)) ([Link to PDF](https://teals-introcs.gitbooks.io/introduction-to-computer-science-principles/content/Unit%205%20PDF/Lab%205.1%20Connect%20the%20Dots.pdf))
- If possible, create large poster-sized versions of the dot grids (each grid is 12 x 3).

## Instructor's Notes

1. Introduce activity
    * Inform students that they will be drawing some figures by following specific instructions
    * Emphasize that students must follow all instructions in the lab carefully
    * Throughout the activity, ask students to think about other ways they could accomplish the same goals and the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
2. Activity
    * Split students into groups of at least six.  If the number of students is not an exact multiple of six, create a few groups of seven and have students take turns being "active."
    * Students should follow the steps in the lab, being careful to act as a group.
        * In each part, the group will draw the letter 'C' six times, using slightly different instructions.
    * Students should, hopefully, notice that in part 3, they are able to achieve similar but not exactly the same results by all following the same instructions.  (Though each student draws a 'C', they are not all in the same location.)  In each part, they were able to improve the efficiency and clarity of the instructions.
3. Debrief
    * Ask each group to share their answers to the questions at the end of each part.
    * Discuss how this approach could be applied to coding.
    * Introduce the terms "prototyping" and "cloning" as (mostly) synonyms:
        * _prototyping: creating a single "master" entity that defines the behavior for a group of objects, then creating many copies of the prototype to duplicate the behavior_
