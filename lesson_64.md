# Lesson 6.4 - Building a Plan

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...
  * Break down, and identify the main technical components needed for the functional project specifications (scenarios)
  * Explain the purpose of each technical component
  * Develop the project idea into a full, detailed specification
  * Create a plan that includes specific steps, ie, list of bite-sized tasks
  * Estimate time required for tasks

#### Emphasize with students ...
#### Curriculum Competencies - Prototype, Test, and Make

From Lessons 6.3 to 6.5 you will be practicing an "Agile" iterative and incremental project management workflow.  In Lesson 6.3 you identified user scenarios.  Now in Lesson 6.4 you identify what technical components are needed for each scenario,  and define all the tasks that need to be done.  You are not "coding" yet.

Each defined task, or step, should be bite-sized, and specific enough to do.  
This plan should include testing done by you, as the developer, and by other users.
As you progress, gather feedback from users/testers over time, and make changes to your design, and plan, as needed.

#### Curriculum Competencies - Applied Technologies

Your classroom may have a diverse student population, and include English Language Learning (ELL) students.  
Following an Agile project management flow helps ensure that the development process is simple, clear to follow, well documented, and easy to share and evaluate.  Practicing these skills will help students collaborate and share their work in diverse classrooms.  These skills prepare students to engage more successfully in an increasingly global technology industry.

| 20 minutes | Spec writing |
| 15 minutes | Building implementation plan|
| 5 minutes | Debrief and wrap-up|

## Instructor's Notes
1. Review
    * Ask students to take out their feature lists and wireframes from [Lesson 6.3](lesson_63.md). They will be using these to develop a more detailed specification and plan for their project today.
    * If time allows, ask one or two students to share their feature list and/or wireframe and discuss with the class.
        * Ensure that students have an understanding of the proper level of detail at this point.
2. Spec writing
    * Using the details from their pitch, their feature lists, their wireframes, and the feedback they've received, students should fill out the rest of the [plan organizer](Final Project Plan Organizer.docx).
        * It is **VITAL** at this stage that students be as detailed and thorough as they can.  Any missing information will complicate the process later when they realize what was left out.  Encourage students to take their time and make sure they hit everything.
        * While this process is happening, instructors should circulate through the class and check-in with student.  Verify that they have a complete, well-thought out idea that is feasible to complete in the available time.  
            * If you have concerns about a student's ability to complete the proposed project, help them scope down by removing or simplifying features.
3. Implementation plan
    * Students should use the details built in their plan organizer to list the tasks necessary on their [Final Project Development Plan](Final Project Development Plan.docx).
        * Emphasize to students that tasks should be at a very low level of granularity (hence the time requirement being specified in minutes).  If a single task has a time estimate of more than a few hours, the student should try to break the task into smaller pieces.
        * Ensure that students do not skip "trivial" or "simple" tasks (such as building a script they have written before) or non-coding tasks (such as developing graphics) in their plan.

4. Debrief
    * As class ends, remind students that their spec and implementation plan will be their guides throughout the process.  They should update them each day and keep them with them at all times.
    * Ideally, anytime there is a question about the requirements or scope of the project, the spec should have the answer.  If not, it's a new idea and the spec needs to be updated accordingly.
