# Lesson 0.5: Snap! Coordinate System

The lesson is important to cover if students have not learned the concept of the coordinate system and plotting (x,y) coordinates.

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Recall the Cartesian coordinate system.
* Implement the coordinate system to position a sprite using Snap! Coordinates.

## Materials/Preparation

* [Do Now: Draw the Coordinate System](do_now_05.md).
* [0.5 Slide Deck](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/slidedecks/TEALS%20SNAP%200.5.pptx)
* [Lab 0.5 handout (Getting to know Coordinates)](lab_05.md) ([docx](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%200/lab_05.docx)) ([pdf](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%200/lab_05.pdf)).
* Familiarize yourself with this [Coordinate System](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ui4klsjued) tool.
  * Students will be entering coordinates on the left side of the screen
  * The points will plot on the graph.
* Familiarize yourself with this [Snap!Template](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=aspiece%40gmail.com&ProjectName=Snap%20Coordinate%20System%20Intro).
* Familiarize yourself with the [Peabody Test](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=aspiece%40gmail.com&ProjectName=PeabodyTest).
* [Unit 0 Tips](unit_0_tips.md).
* Here is a place to print [Graph Paper](https://free-printable-paper.com/graph-paper/) in case it is necessary to print graph paper for the class.

## Instructor's Notes

### Introduce Activity

* Explain to students the Snap! coordinate system using the grid they have drawn from the Dow Now.
* Define the Origin and that its center is (0,0).
* Define the Grid Limits of positive and negative 240 on the x-axis and positive and negative 180 on the y-axis.

### Classroom Activity

(_This classroom activity is optional - use it if you think your class could use the additional scaffolding._)

Together as a class, practice plotting a few points on the Snap! Coordinate System.
Use [this coordinate tool](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ui4klsjued) to have the students plot points.

* This has been pre-configured with the dimensions of the Snap! grid so they can see the points being graphed.
* Have students enter the points on the left side of the tool and the points will be plotted on the graph on the right.
* Note that the grid lines are set to 10 unit increments.
* Have them plot the following points.
  * (0, 0)
  * (50, -50)
  * (100, 0)
  * (50, 100)

Ask students if they connect the dots, what shape would the points make? (Answers may vary: Kite, Diamond, Quadrilateral, Polygon, etc).

### 3. Integrate

Explain to students that this is how the Snap! stage is setup but it doesn't have a grid to view.
The origin (0,0) is the exact center of the grid.

* Have students enter the following points into the **go to x: y:** in the [template](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=aspiece%40gmail.com&ProjectName=Snap%20Coordinate%20System%20Intro)
  * (0, 0)
  * (50, -50)
  * (100, 0)
  * (50, 100)
* Now have students click the Green Flag to see the sprite draw the shape.
* Now instruct the students to use the block template to draw at least two shapes of their own.

### 4. Lab Activity

* Introduce the Lab Activity to students by explaining the instructions and getting them started with the activity.

### 5 . Debrief

* Can you think of any other technologies that use a coordinate system to display graphics?
* Are there any blocks that you have discovered that have helped you draw shapes faster?

## Accommodation/Differentiation

* Kinesthetic learners could use graph paper to draw the shapes with a writing utensil.
* Challenge students who understand this challenge them to draw more complex figures and allow them to explore other blocks that may be useful to do this faster. (i.e Repeat Blocks, etc).
* Students will have different levels of prior knowledge on this topic. The objective of this lesson is to level set students to ensure they all have an understanding of coordinates. There may be students seeing coordinates for the first time that may need more 1 on 1 support to move through this lesson.
