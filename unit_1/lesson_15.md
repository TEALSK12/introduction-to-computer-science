# Lesson 1.5: Storytelling Project

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Apply Snap! programming skills to create an animated movie, play, nursery rhyme, or other scene.
* Practice good debugging skills to correct issues as they arise while programming.

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Review

* Play a review game (such as [GrudgeBall](http://toengagethemall.blogspot.com/2013/02/grudgeball-review-game-where-kids-attack.html) to remind students of the skills and concepts that have been learned in this unit.
* Categories of blocks.
  * `Movement`
  * `Drawing`
  * `Hide/Show`
  * `Costumes`
  * `Broadcasting`
* Remind students that their solutions to previous assignments are an excellent resource when trying to accomplish similar tasks.

### 2. Introduce project

* Walk students through project specification, pointing out important details, potential pitfalls, and specific requirements.
* The words to the story must appear on the screen somehow.
* This can be as a sprite, as a part of the background, or "said" by a narrator
* Sprites must act out the story line by line.
* The action must be dynamic-- a series of static images is not sufficient.
* The action and words should advance automatically, but at a slow enough pace that the viewer can follow.
* The user must be able to restart the animation (in a manner other than pressing the green flag again) after it has concluded.
* At least two sprites must act during the animation, and the sprites must collectively meet the requirements on page 2.
* Encourage students to look at the grading rubric on page two repeatedly throughout the project to ensure they are meeting all the requirements.

### 3.  Project

* This project is a summative assessment for the unit.  Students should be demonstrating mastery of all the skills covered.
* Most students will require roughly 4-8 hours of total work time to complete the project.
* Assess the progress of your students regularly using such techniques as asking them to demonstrate their incomplete programs, tracking questions asked during lab time, and/or utilizing peer reviews.
* Adjust the amount of time allowed for the project to fit the needs of your students.
* It is vital that nearly all students complete the project before moving on.
* If most students have the ability to work on Snap! assignments at home, the amount of in-class time provided can be reduced if necessary.
* If this approach is taken, be sure to make accommodations for students who are _not_ able to work at home, such as after school lab hours.
* Ensure that students are able to ask questions in class throughout the project.
* See the standard [Lab Day Lesson](../lab_day_lesson.md) for detailed plans for lab days.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

* Instead of a scene from a play or a nursery rhyme, students can recreate a famous scene from a movie, depict lyrics from their favorite song, or develop their own unique animations.  Feel free to modify the specification for whichever version will appeal most to your students.
* Advanced students can be encouraged to add detail and/or complexity to their project for possible extra credit.
* For ELL students or students from other cultures, offer the opportunity to choose an animation subject familiar to them rather than requiring a traditional English nursery rhyme or play.
* If necessary, a non-English language can be ``used for this assignment without affecting the learning objectives.  Discuss this option with the student's ELL specialist to determine if it is appropriate.
