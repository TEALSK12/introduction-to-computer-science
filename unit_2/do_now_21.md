# Do Now 2.1 Intro Loops

Go to this [starter project](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=whuangpha&ProjectName=160205%20Do%20Now%20User%20Input), run the code and test it, then answer these questions in a discussion comment below.

1. What is the forever block, and why is it important for this code?
2. What happens if you take it out temporarily, reattach the rest of the code to the "When Green Flag clicked" block, and run/test the code?
3. What does "point direction 90" do to the sprite?
4. What would happen if you decrease or increase the # of steps?
5. Add code so that if the user presses the left arrow key, the sprite faces the left direction and moves a few steps in that direction. Test to make sure that this works and also that right arrow key still works.
