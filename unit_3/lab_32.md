# Lab 3.2 - What Goes Up

In this lab, you will use everything you've learned about loops and conditionals to construct a simple model for gravity.

## Part 1: Before You Start

Go to the starter project at [https://aka.ms/Intro-lab3-2](https://aka.ms/Intro-lab3-2). Log into Snap! and save your own copy of the project by choosing `Save as` button from the file menu. Be sure to click the `Share` button in the Save dialog box. Highlight the URL in the address bar and copy it.

## Part 2: Channeling Newton

Write a script for the Dino sprite so that:

2.1) When the `green flag` is clicked, Dino goes to the top of the stage.

2.2) When the `green flag` is clicked, Dino falls to the bottom of the stage in a `forever` block.

2.3) When Dino touches the ground, Dino stops falling.

When using the `touching color` block, change the color by clicking on the color box, then select anything in the color palette or stage that has the desired color.

## Part 3: What goes up, Must Come Down

3.1) Modify your code so that when the `green flag` is clicked, Dino will move to the top of the stage and it will move to a random x-coordinate between -240 and 240.  Use the `pick random` block in the `operators` category.

3.2) Modify your code so that the Dino sprite stops falling when it touches the ground `or` if it is touching the Platform.  

## Part 4: Jump Up

4.1) Modify your code so that when the `spacebar` is pressed, Dino will jump up.  

Have Dino jump by using a `repeat` block with a `change in y` block in it that will move Dino up.  Dino will have to move up faster than you think since it will be fighting the `forever` block that causes it to always go down.

## Part 5: Challenge

5.1) Modify your code so Dino can only jump while on the ground or the platform?

5.2) Add code so Dino will move left and right with the `arrow` keys?
