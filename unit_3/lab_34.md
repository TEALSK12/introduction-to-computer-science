# Lab 3.4 - If My Calculations Are Correct

In this lab, you will write custom `reporter` and `predicate` blocks to perform several useful calculations and computations.

## Simple Computations

1. Write a custom Snap! `reporter` block called `min` that determines which of two numbers is smaller and reports that value.  If the two numbers are equal, report either one.

2. Write a custom Snap! `reporter` block called `max` that determines which of two numbers is larger and reports that value.  If the two numbers are equal, report either one.

3. Write a custom Snap! `predicate` block called `between` that determines if a number is between two other numbers.  If the first number is equal to either of the other two numbers or is between them, the block should report "true".

4. Write a custom Snap! `predicate` called `at least as long as` that determines whether a word has at least a specified number of letters.

## Bonus: Stepping Things Up

Write a custom Snap! `reporter` block called `distance to` that computes and reports the distance from a sprite's position to another point.  Use the `x position` and `y position` blocks to determine the sprite's position.  Remember that the formula for the distance between points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is `sqrt((y2-y1)^2+(x2-x1)^2)`.
