# Lesson 3.2: Combining Loops and Conditionals

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Combine loops with conditionals to create models with repeated but conditional behavior.

## Instructor's Notes

### Review and lecture

#### Review loops and conditionals

* Ask students what loops do, when they are useful, and what loops exist in Snap!.
  * Loops cause code to execute multiple times.
  * Loops can help reduce redundancy and increase readability.
  * Snap! contains three loops: repeat, forever, and repeat until.
* Ask students what conditionals are for and when they are useful.
  * conditionals are used to execute a block of code only under certain circumstances.
  * Encourage discussion about previous activities.
  * Fill in understanding gaps when necessary.

#### Demonstrate combining loops and conditionals

* Present `repeat until` and `forever if` blocks.

  ![Repeat Until Block](../images/repeat_until.png)
  
  ![Forever Block](../images/forever_if.png)

* Ask students to suggest when these constructs might be useful.
  * `repeat until` is useful when a loop needs to run not for a set number of iterations, but until some situation occurs.
  * `forever if` is useful when a script should execute _any time_ a condition is true, for the duration of the program.
  * Point out that the condition in `repeat until` is a termination condition, while in `forever-if` it is a continuation condition.

#### Introduce the concept of modeling

* **Modeling:** building a system to simulate the behavior of a real-life phenomenon by simplifying or ignoring certain details.
* Ask students to suggest systems or concepts that might need to be modeled.
* Discuss important considerations when designing and implementing a model.
  * Lead students to realize that most sacrifice some amount of accuracy or realism for simplicity.

### Activity

* Students should complete "What Goes Up..." lab individually.
* Mention that the script written in this lab will be helpful for the end of unit project.

### Debrief

## Accommodations/Differentiation

* Take care to ensure that all students have a functional script by the end of the lab to avoid putting some students at a disadvantage starting the project.
* If many students struggle, consider releasing your own solution after the lab has been completed in class.
* Ask the more advanced students to assist struggling students. It is vital that all students complete this lab in advance of starting the project.
* Advanced students can consider increasing the realism of their gravity model by adding acceleration and/or beginning to implement jumping.
