# Do Now 5.2 Star Wars Troopers

1. In Star Wars, what are "clone troopers"? Do an internet search to find out and write a sentence to answer the question.

2. Go to this [Snap!project](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=whuangpha&ProjectName=160425%20Do%20Now%20cloning). Duplicate the sprite (and scripts) so that there are 5 clone troopers that move from the right side of the screen to the left side in a straight line when green flag is clicked. The starting and ending positions of the sprites are shown below.

Start:
